Cloud King	CloudKing_Satisfied	Ah, new Crystal Keeper, there you are! Welcome to the Cloudy Kingdom! Allow me to explain what your new job entails.
Cloud King	CloudKing_Talking	The Cloudy Kingdom has four central regions that you're in charge of maintaining: the sunny region, the snowy region, the windy region, and the rainy region.
Cloud King	CloudKing_Talking	Each region has a Guardian who helps protect the Kingdom from adversaries -- such as my brother.
Cloud King	CloudKing_Sad	Banished years ago, my brother is now known as the fearsome Lord of Storms, an evil wizard who tried to take over the Kingdom--
 	Blank	Suddenly, dark clouds loom overhead…
 	LordOfStorms	Thunder booms and lightning strikes as The Lord of Storms appears. 
Lord of Storms	LordOfStorms_Upset	Ha! You really thought you could get rid of me that easily? 
Lord of Storms	LordOfStorms_Smirk	Dear brother, you were always too kind for your own good. Now, it’s time to recognize who the TRUE king is!
Lord of Storms	LordOfStorms    And don’t worry about your lovely Guardians. They’re now under my watchful eye, and I think you’ll appreciate the changes I’ve made to them and their lands.
Lord of Storms	LordOfStorms_Smirk	Now, it's time to take my fitting place on the throne!
 	Blank	The Lord of Storms laughs manically, disappearing in a sudden puff of smoke...
Cloud King	CloudKing_Surprised	Crystal Keeper, are you alright? It seems that the Lord of Storms is up to no good again.
Cloud King	CloudKing_Sad	In his attempt to claim the Kingdom as his own, he has created vicious weather patterns and placed a nasty curse on the Guardians...
Cloud King	CloudKing_Surprised	As our Crystal Keeper, I must ask for your help in saving Cloudy Kingdom! 
Cloud King	CloudKing_Talking	By collecting Weather Crystals, you can heal our kingdom from this wretched weather, and return the guardians to their rightful form!
Cloud King	CloudKing_Talking	Let me teach you how it's done!
Cloud King	CloudKing_Talking	Swipe to connect Crystals and gain points! If you align three crystals of the same type horizontally or vertically, you'll make a 3 combo. Give it a try!
Cloud King	CloudKing_Satisfied	You're a natural! As expected of our Crystal Keeper.
Cloud King	CloudKing_Talking	You can also match four of the same Crystals together to make a 4 combo. Give it a whirl!
Cloud King	CloudKing_Satisfied	Great work!
Cloud King	CloudKing_Talking	Now, match five of the same Crystals together to make a 5 combo. Try it out!
Cloud King	CloudKing_Satisfied	Excellent, excellent! You can also increase the speed that the Crystals emerge at if you feel confident in your Crystal matching abilities.
Cloud King	CloudKing_Talking	Try making an L combo by matching similar Crystals in an L shape. Have a go at it!
Cloud King	CloudKing_Satisfied	Finally, once you've gained enough points, you can use a Bomb power-up. Use it and see what happens!
Cloud King	CloudKing_Satisfied	Magnificent job, Crystal Keeper! You're well on your way to defeat The Lord of Storms. 
Cloud King	CloudKing_Talking	Please traverse our lands, heal our guardians, defeat The Lord of Storms in the Cloudy Castle, and save us all!
Cloud King	CloudKing_Talking	The kingdom's fate rests in your hands.
