Sunny Guardian	Corrupted Sunny Guardian_Annoyed	You just don't know when to quit, do you? I've already had to drag myself out of my cave twice now to deal with you.
Sunny Guardian	Corrupted Sunny Guardian_Bored	You must be truly bored with your life if you're still bothering with this fool's errand. Not like anything you do will stop the inevitable cheerless doom we all face.
Sunny Guardian	Corrupted Sunny Guardian_Annoyed	Fine, I suppose if it'll get you to leave me alone faster, I'll put in some effort to end this. Though we all know nothing really matters in the end anyway.
