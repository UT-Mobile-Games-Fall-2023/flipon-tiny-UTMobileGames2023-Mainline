Sunny Guardian    Corrupted Sunny Guardian_Annoyed    Ugh, who disrupted my rest? Can’t a lion wallow in peace?
Sunny Guardian    Corrupted Sunny Guardian_Deadpan    Wait, you must be that new Crystal Keeper. The Lord of Storms said someone might darken my cave today. Lucky me.
Sunny Guardian    Corrupted Sunny Guardian_Bored    Whatever, we both know you can't actually stop him. But by all means, give it your best shot...

Sunny Guardian    Corrupted Sunny Guardian_Annoyed    Ugh you’re still here? Why won't you just give up already.
Sunny Guardian    Corrupted Sunny Guardian    
Sunny Guardian    Corrupted Sunny Guardian_Deadpan    Whatever, go ahead and take a shot at my defenses. I could use some more disappointment in my life.

Sunny Guardian    Corrupted Sunny Guardian_Annoyed    You just don't know when to quit, do you? I've already had to drag myself out of my cave twice now to deal with you.
Sunny Guardian    Corrupted Sunny Guardian_Bored    You must be truly bored with your life if you're still bothering with this fool's errand. Not like anything you do will stop the inevitable cheerless doom we all face.
Sunny Guardian    Corrupted Sunny Guardian_Annoyed    Fine, I suppose if it'll get you to leave me alone faster, I'll put in some effort to end this. Though we all know nothing really matters in the end anyway.

Regular Sunny Guardian_Happy    Golly! I can't thank you enough for rescuing me from that gloomy spell, friend! But it seems your work of spreading cheer is only just beginning.
Sunny Guardian    Corrupted Sunny Guardian_Neutral    Sunny Guardian
Sunny Guardian    Corrupted Sunny Guardian_Worried    Normally he's quite the upbeat fellow, but I fear the Lord of Storms has made him rather...strict.
Sunny Guardian    Corrupted Sunny Guardian_Optimistic    Still, with your sparkling spirit I know you'll have him beaming again in no time flat! Best of luck on your adventure, my friend - I know the sunshine will guide your way.

Snowy Guardian    Regular Snowy Guardian_Happy    Whoaaa, major thanks for breaking that dark spell on me! Must've been totally dragging the good vibes down as Lord Buzzkill's henchman. My bad!
Snowy Guardian    Regular Snowy Guardian_Neutral    Head to the windy region next, crystal dude - gotta save our airborne amiga from that wack storm dude.
Snowy Guardian    Regular Snowy Guardian_Worried    Word is that he warped the wise old wind guardian's energy big time - turned her into a total loose cannon! And coming from yours truly, that's sayin' something.
Snowy Guardian    Regular Snowy Guardian_Optimistic    But I know you got the mad skills to twist this storm around, my crystal-cool dude. Best of luck out there and hang ten, brahh!
